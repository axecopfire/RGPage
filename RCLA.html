            <h2>Our Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><h4>Our History</h4><p>The Rossman Center for Language Acquisition seeks to expand people's view of the world as the premier service provider of language and culture education, recognized for its flexibility and responsiveness to customer needs.</p></li>
                <li><h4>Who We Are</h4><p>The Rossman Center for Language Acquisition is a language school located in Augusta, Georgia. It is the brainchild of Lydia Rossman, a professional language learner and prior military language analyst. She leads a team that has a combined total of over 50 years of experience working for the Department of Defense language community. Established in 2012 as The Rossman Group LLC, TRCFLA serves the military, Government, and civilian professional language communities. In 2016 The Rossman Group LLC began operating the language school as The Rossman Center for Language Acquisition in order to more transparently convey its mission.</p></li>
                <li><h4>Why</h4><p>The Rossman Center for Language Acquisition was born out of a recognized need for more flexible training of professional linguists. Provided training did not line up with stated training goals, and professional linguists were frustrated at not having access to the tools they knew they needed in order to meet their testing goals, maintain proficiency, and keep their jobs. TRCFLA works to equip professional linguists with the language and testing skills needed to exceed their goals and excell in their careers.</p></li>

            <h2>Language Courses</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><h4>Familiarization</h4><p>Familiarization in a language focuses on “survival skills”. Students are trained in how to read the alphabet, recognize numbers, read signs, understand directions, seek medical care, order from a restaurant, make travel arrangements, and hold a basic conversation. They should also understand the most important cultural do’s and don’t’s. Familiarization training can focus on specific skills such as search and rescue, medical aid, humanitarian aid, interdiction, search and seizure, and/or any operational requirements as specified.</p></li>
                <li><h4>Basic Acquisition</h4><p>Basic acquisition is for students who have no or limited experience in a foreign language. Students are trained as though they are actual students in the country in which the language they are studying is spoken. They are taken from toddlerhood to being a teenager in their language through an immersion style program. TRCFLA is able to balance multiple learning styles and present material in an engaging way so that students absorb knowledge in order to fully understand, yet they still are treated as adults.</p></li>
                <li><h4>Remediation</h4><p>Remedial language training is for students who have been trained and reached the 2/2/1+ standard of proficiency, but whose skills have fallen below the standard. Remedial training focuses on repairing the cracks and holes in the language foundation, and building a sturdy language framework for the student to rely on for the rest of their career. Remedial training at TRCFLA provides not only intensive language study, but an emphasis on test-taking skills necessary to pass the DLPT.</p></li>
                <li><h4>Intermediate</h4><p>Intermediate foreign language training is for those students who have achieved a minimum of 2/2+/1+, or 2+/2/1+ on the DLPT. Intermediate training focuses on idiomatic language and intangible concepts within language in order to understand the native speaker in an authentic context.</p></li>
                <li><h4>Advanced</h4><p>Advanced foreign language training is for students who have achieved a minimum of 2+/2+/2 on the DLPT. Advanced training focuses on university level academic skills within the target language as well as advanced social language such as blogs, vlogs, debate, editorials, technical papers, and other media. Advanced training can focus on specific subjects that require highly technical language skills as needed.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Culture Courses</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><h4>General Culture</h4><p>General training focuses on a cultural overview of a specific country or region. Knowledge is presented as generalities and broad concepts with only the most important aspects discussed in great detail. This course addresses the psychological and emotional issues associated with culture shock, how to interact with people of different cultures, how different cultures affect the workplace, and how culture shapes other people’s view of Americans.</p></li>
                <li><h4>Culture Specific</h4><p>Culture specific training is for students who expect to spend significant amounts of time in contact with the native population of a specific country or sub-culture. This course requires significant interaction with native speakers and academic knowledge is presented in context.</p></li>
