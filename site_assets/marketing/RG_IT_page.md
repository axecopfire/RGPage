 Training Methodology
We have all sat in the large lecture hall with 300 of our closest friends listening to the Professor in “Intro to….”. We take notes, read the assigned reading, and learn enough to regurgitate the information and do well on the exams. But how much do we actually understand of the information presented? With little interaction between Professor and students… and who really wants to raise their hand and ask a question in front of 300 people… it can be a challenge to grasp difficult concepts.

The Rossman Center provides small classes; with an average teacher to student ration of 5:1. Students are given the opportunity to have one-on-one training, ask the difficult questions, and truly understand the material necessary to obtain certification and do the job.

Students are given hands-on, scenario based training in order to learn how to handle the challenges they will face on the job. Upon completion, students will have a strong grasp on the latest methods in Information Technology and Information Assurance functions.
